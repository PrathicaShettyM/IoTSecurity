        question: "How can implementing a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) improve the security of communication between IoT devices?",
        answer: "d. Each device has a unique digital certificate for secure communication",
        options: [
            "a. Devices share a single master password for authentication",
            "b. All data is encrypted using a symmetric key algorithm - Less secure than PKI",
            "c. IoT devices rely on a centralized server for access control - Can be a security bottleneck",
